Basic XML Commands
	These commands are used to execute the XML commands listed in Spectra Logic's Tape XML guide. Output is cleaned and printed to the shell.

	add-key			Add an option key to the library. Specify the key with the --key flag.
	audit-inventory		verify the contents of a TeraPack against the values stored in the database. TFINITY only. Requires --partition, --element-type, and --offset. Offset can be determined with the physical-inventory command. Values required are one-less than the value returned by physical-inventory. Subtract one from the value for the proper format.
	audit-inventory-results	returns the results of the audit inventory command.
	check-progress		check the progress of the specified command. Use -o/--option to specify the progress of what, e.g. --option asl to see ASL progress. Currently supported options are: asl, controller, drive-list, etherlib, package-update.
	create-partition-auto	automatically creates one partition with all the available slots in the library. Can only be run if there are no existing partitions in the library. Use --partition to name the partition and --save-to to specify whether the configuration should be saved to a usb or sent to an email.
	delete-partition	deletes a partition from the library. Use --partition to specify the partition name and --save-to to specify whether the new configuration should be saved to usb ro sent to an email.
	disable-failover	disables controller redundancy for the specified primary controller. User -o/--option to specify controller in FR[#]/DBA[#]/F-QIP[#] format where [#] represents the number designating each value for the controller. Use list-controllers to see a list of assigned controllers.
	download-asl		download the specified autosupport log (ASL). Use -o/--option to specify the file name. File will appear in the ../output directory.
	drive-load-count	prints the number of times the drive was loaded. Must specify the drive in FR[#]/DBA[#]/DR[#] format with the option flag.
	empty-bulk-tap		Empties the bulk TAP. Use --tap to specify left, right, or both and --partition to specify which partition to load the tapes into.
	enable-controller	(full command enable-controller-failover) enables failover for the specified controller. Must specify --controller and --spare.
	etherlib-status		prints the status of the library's EtherLib connections.
	firmware-versions	displays the current firmware versions installed on individual components in the library.
	generate-asl		generates a new autosupport log (ASL).
	generate-drive-trace	generates a drive trace for the specified drive in FR[#]/DBA[#]/DR[#] format.
	get-drive-trace		retrieves a most recently generated drive traces from the library. Options are download, usb, and email. Download saves the file "drive_traces.zip" to the output folder. USB saves the traces to a usb drive inserted in the LCM. Email sends the traces to the specified email if the email is configured in the library.
	library-status		provides a complete status report on the library and all components.
	list-asls		provides a list of autosupport logs (ASLs) available in the library.
	list-controllers	provides a list of controllers assigned in the library.
	list-drives		provides a list of all drives in the libraries along with detailed information.
	list-hhm-data		provides a list of all HHM values in the library.
	list-inventory		provides a complete slot-based inventory list for a partititon. This executes the inventory.xml?action=list command. Partition name must be specified with the -o/--option flag. For a list of partitions use the list-partitions command.
	list-mlm		provides a list of all MLM settings in the library.
	list-keys		provides a list of all option (activation) keys assigned to the library.
	list-packages		provides the name of the currently installed packages as well as all packages stored on the LCM.
	list-partitions		provides a list of all partitions in the library, including cleaning partitions. No options exist for this command.
	list-settings		provides a list of basic library settings such as library name and what options are enabled.
	move-details		returns move statistics for the last 10 moves. TFINITY ONLY.
	move-status		returns the status of the last executed move.
	package-details		displayed the current firmware version installed on individual components in the library along with the firmware version included in the specified BlueScale package. Use --package to specify the BlueScale package.
	partition-details	provides detailed information on the partitions in the library. Use the -o/--option flag to specify the partition to limit output to a single partition.
	physical-inventory	provides a complete Tera-Pack based inventory list for a partition. Partition name must be specified with the -o/--option flag.
	rcm-status		provides information on the status of the RCM specified with the --rcm flg.
	refresh-ec-info		Refreshes the WebUI with the current hardware EC info.
	refresh-environment	Refreshes the WebUI with the current hardware information.
	refresh-etherlib	Attempts to reestablish the Ethernet connection and update the stored status information for each EtherLib connection.
	replace-drive		starts the process to safely replace the drive in the library. Drive is specified in FR[#]/DBA[#]/DR[#] format as an option.
	reset-drive		resets the specified drive. Drive is specified in FR[#]/DBA[#]/DR[#] format as an option.
	reset-hhm-counter	resets the specified HHM counter to 0. **DO NOT PERFORM THIS OPERATION WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION FROM SPECTRA LOGIC SUPPORT** Required inputs are --type, --subtype, (and with TFINITY libraries --robot).
	resize-partition	resize the number of slots in a partition. Use --partition to specify the partition name, --type to specify storage or EE slots, and --value to specify number. Putting a negative sign (-) in front of the number will cause the slots to be removed instead of added. Slots can only be added or subtracted in TeraPack increments (10s for LTO and 9s for TS).
	set-hhm-threshold	sets the specified HHM alert threshold. **DO NOT PERFORM THIS OPERATION WITHOUT APPROVAL FROM SPECTRA LOGIC SUPPORT** Required inputs are --event, --keepDefault to reset to default or --value to set to specific value.
	set-mlm			Allows MLM and writing to noncertified MAM chips to be enabled. Use --setting to specify mlm or noncertified and --value for enable or disable.
	stage-package		Starts the background process to stage firmware to all library components that support staging (RCM, RIM(2), DCM). Use --package to specify the package name.
	tap-status		returns the status of the specified TAP. User --tap and --drawer.
	update-package		updates the library to the specified BlueScale package. Use --package to specify the BlueScale package. RCM and LCM will restart automatically after the process.
	update-result		Returns status information on the most recent BlueScale update. Will reboot the LCM and RCM if they were updated during this process.
	update-setting		Allows modification of the setting specified in update setting using the --setting and --value flags. Aside from libary-name setting, all values can either be enable or disable. SNMP settings cannot be modified by the XML interface.
	upload-package		Upload a package to the library. Specify the package to upload with the --file flag.
