Advanced XML Commands
	These commands string together multiple basic XML commands or execute scripts against the output of commands in order to acheive more advanced functionality within the library. A partition name must be specified with all of these commands using the --partition flag. By default moves will be sent to the library. This only works with current versions of BlueScale on TFinity libraries. For other library types and older versions of BlueScale, a MoveQueue.txt file can be generated with the --output-format move-queue flag.

	calibrate-drives	Calibrates robot positioning by moving tapes from storage slots to all drives in the partition and returns them to their home slot. Use --output-format move-queue to prepare a MoveQueue.txt file instead of sending the moves directly to the library.
	create-partitions	Creates partitions as defined in the specified --file
	drive-status		Prints a one-line status for each drive specified with --partition flag. Includes drive number, type, serial number, health, and (if loaded) barcode.
	eject-empty-terapacks	Queries the library partition for a list of empty TeraPacks within the storage partition. A move list is generated by this command and uploaded to the library. Empty TeraPacks can then be exported from the front panel of the library using the Advanced Import/Export options via the uploaded move list. Partition must be specified with the --partition flag.
	eject-listed-tapes	Prepares an import/export list for all TeraPacks containing a tape in the specified list. Use --file-name to specify the file containing the tape list. If --output-format [move-que | send] flag is used, tapes will be moved to available entry/exit slots instead of exporting the containing TeraPack.
	eject-terapack		Ejects the specified TeraPack (--terapack BARCODE) or the TeraPack containing the specified tape (--tape BARCODE). Requires --partition flag.
	find-faulted-power	Queries XML to identify which power supply is faulted and why.
	group-listed-tapes	Moves tapes specified in a list to an empty TeraPack. Use --file-name to specify the file containing the tape list and --output-format move-queue to save as a MoveQueue file.
	library-type		Returns the type of library, i.e. T680, T950, TFinity.
	magazine-compaction	Automates the recompaction of TeraPacks within the specified partition. The goal of the recompaction is to empty TeraPacks by moving tapes in almost empty TeraPacks to fuller ones. A maximum number of allowed moves per command can be specified with the -m/--move option. The purpose of this option is to allow this command to be executed against production libraries in order to prevent the recompaction from monopolizing the robotics, causing production moves to fail. The default value 10 is used if no maximum is specified. Partition must be specified with the --partition flag. This command currently only works with TFinitys. However a move list can be generated for upload into other Spectra Libraries with the --output-format move-queue flag.
	magazine-contents	Prints a list of magazine contents to the shell. The information included in this output is the magazine-barcode, number of slots utilized (utilizaton), and the tape barcode in each slot. Similar output to the basic XML command physicalInventory.xml. Partition must be specified with the --partition flag.
	magazine-utilization	Generates a breakdown of Terapacks based on how full they are. Can be used to determine the availability of slots in the library and if there are any empty TeraPacks. Output includes Entry/Exit Slots. Partition must be specified with the --partition flag.
	maintenance-hhm-reset	Resets the applicable HHM counters after a preventative maintenance engagement.
	organize-inventory	Sort the inventory to be in numeric/alphabetic order. Must specify --partition and --max-moves. --output-format move-queue can be used to generate a MoveQueue.txt file.
	prepare-slotiq		Prepares a library for enabling Slot IQ by ensuring each TeraPack has at least 1 open slot. Requires --partition, --moves flag. Can generate move queue instead of sending moves with --output-type move-queue flag.
