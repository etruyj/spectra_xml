Basic XML Commands
	These commands are used to execute the XML commands listed in Spectra Logic's Tape XML guide. Output is printed without xml tags by default. XML formatting can be maintained with the --output-format xml flag. Spectra's XML Command Reference Guide can be located under the Documentation page of support.spectralogic.com.

	abort-audit		Aborts an in-progress security audit. Not to be used with audit-inventory command.
	add-key			Add an option key to the library. Specify the key with the --key flag.
	audit-inventory		verify the contents of a TeraPack against the values stored in the database. TFINITY only. Requires --partition, --element-type, and --offset. Offset can be determined with the physical-inventory command. Values required are one-less than the value returned by physical-inventory. Subtract one from the value for the proper format.
	audit-inventory-results	returns the results of the audit inventory command.
	audit-status		reports the status of a security audit. Does not report the status of the audit-inventory command.
	check-progress		check the progress of the specified command. Use -o/--option to specify the progress of what, e.g. --option asl to see ASL progress. Currently supported options are: asl, controller, drive-list, etherlib, package-update.
	create-partition-auto	automatically creates one partition with all the available slots in the library. Can only be run if there are no existing partitions in the library. Use --partition to name the partition and --save-to to specify whether the configuration should be saved to a usb or sent to an email.
	delete-partition	deletes a partition from the library. Use --partition to specify the partition name and --save-to to specify whether the new configuration should be saved to usb ro sent to an email.
	disable-failover	disables controller redundancy for the specified primary controller. User -o/--option to specify controller in FR[#]/DBA[#]/F-QIP[#] format where [#] represents the number designating each value for the controller. Use list-controllers to see a list of assigned controllers.

	save-robot-state	saves infomration about whether a tape is currently in the picker or was in the picker when the robot went nto service as well as wether a TeraPack is currently in the transporter. This action should only be run on TFINITY libraries when a robot is in the service back. Execute the refresh-environment followed by the library-status commands to retrieve the robot state.

	stage-package		Starts the background process to stage firmware to all library components that support staging (RCM, RIM(2), DCM). Use --package to specify the package name.
	start-audit		starts a security audit of every magazine in the TFinity to ensure the tapes in the magazine are located where they're expected. This is a whole library version of the audit-inventory command. If only one magazine (or a few) is targeted, the audit-inventory command will have smaller impact on library operations. Do not execute on a production library.
	system-messages		provides all system messages currently stored in the library.
	tap-status		returns the status of the specified TAP. User --tap and --drawer.
	update-package		updates the library to the specified BlueScale package. Use --package to specify the BlueScale package. RCM and LCM will restart automatically after the process.
	update-result		Returns status information on the most recent BlueScale update. Will reboot the LCM and RCM if they were updated during this process.
	update-setting		Allows modification of the setting specified in update setting using the --setting and --value flags. Aside from libary-name setting, all values can either be enable or disable. SNMP settings cannot be modified by the XML interface.
	upload-package		Upload a package to the library. Specify the package to upload with the --file flag.
	verify-magazine-barcodes runs the advanced utility to check all magazine barcodes against the stored inventory. Any moved or added magazine is pulled and the its tapes are scanned. This utility only verifies the inventory of tapes within magazines that were moved since the last inventory. During this process, robotics is unavailable.
